  This was made as a project for a web development course. The goal was to create a responsive and accessible website.
  The website uses accessible technology such as alt-text and aria-labels to make it accessible to a wider audience. 
  All colors have been contrast checked to ensure acessibility. Likewise the website functions with alt-navigation as
  another step to increase the overrall accessibility.
