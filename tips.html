                            A cocktail shaker is a device used to mix beverages (usually alcoholic) by shaking. When ice
                            is put in the shaker, this
                            allows for a quicker cooling of the drink before serving.A shaken cocktail is made by
                            putting the desired ingredients (typically liquor, fruit juices, syrups, liqueurs and ice
                            cubes) in the cocktail shaker. Then it is shaken vigorously for around 10 to 18 seconds,
                            depending upon the size and
                            temperature of the ice.

                            BCE in prehispanic Mexico and South America, where the jar gourd was used as a
                            closed container. In 1520, Hern√°n Cort√©s wrote to King Charles V of Spain of a drink made
                            from cacao, served to
                            Montezuma with much reverence, frothy and foaming from a golden cylinder. Egyptians as long
                            ago as 3500 BCE added spices
                            to their fermented grain concoctions before serving to make them more palatable.By the
                            mid-19th century, the cocktail shaker as we now know it was in wide use, invented by an
                            innkeeper who, while
                            using two containers to pour drinks back and forth between, noticed that one container's
                            mouth was smaller than the
                            other's and held the two together and shook them "for a bit of a show". Rapid design
                            advancement occurred during the
                            late 19th century, with several patent improvements occurring during the 1870s and 1880s
                            (see Patent history below),
                            including the addition of integral strainer mechanisms to shakers.

                            Invented in the late 19th century, its form derives from the fact that all cocktails are
                            traditionally served chilled
                            and contain an aromatic element. Thus, the stem allows the drinker to hold the glass without
                            affecting the temperature
                            of the drink, an important aspect due to the lack of added ice which in other drinks serves
                            to cool the drink, and
                            the wide bowl places the surface of the drink directly under the drinker's nose, ensuring
                            the aromatic element has the
                            desired effect. In the modern day, cocktail glasses without stems are common; however, these
                            glasses warm very quickly,
                            a phenomenon the original stem addressed.
                            Ikea offers a great selection of affordable glassware for cocktails. You are unlikely to
                            find anything cheaper anywhere else. Whatever you're drinking, we have the glassware,
                            glassware sets and more to suit it. Our glasses, cups, and mugs give
                            you an extensive choice of styles and patterns. And we have other essentials, like straws
                            and ice cube makers, too. Our
                            drinkware and glassware sets will help you set the mood and make every occasion more
                            personal and fun.These glasses look and feel like traditional crystal. Crystal is beautiful,
                            but fragile. These glasses are made from
                            crystalline, a strong alternative with the clarity, brilliance and fine tone of genuine
                            crystal when you toast, but
                            don't break as easily. They're dishwasher safe too.</p>

                            beautiful glass? Then this glassware is made for you.The coupe is a Champagne glass with a
                            broad, shallow bowl and a short, elegant stem. It's this iconic round shape that
                            is long rumoured to have been modelled on the breast of young 18th century French Queen,
                            Marie-Antoinette.</p>

                            The term
                            cocktail glass is often used interchangeably with martini glass, despite their differing

                            beautiful and probably tastier too. This low one is perfect for

                            whiskey
                            glass, and lowball glass (or simply lowball), is a short tumbler used for serving spirits,
                            such
                            as whisky, neat or with ice cubes ("on the
                            rocks"). It is also normally used to serve certain cocktails, such as the old fashioned. The
                            true old fashioned glass is
                            decorated in the cut glass style, although most modern examples are pressed glass, made
                            using a
                            mold. The design is
                            essentially English, from the late 18th or 19th century. Plain glass versions are lowball
                            glasses.</p>
