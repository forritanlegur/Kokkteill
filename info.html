                            Stocking a bar doesn‚Äôt have to be intimidating‚Äîor prohibitively expensive. All you really
                            need is a handful of home bar
                            essentials (many of which you might already have in your kitchen) and the bottles required
                            to make your favorite
                            cocktails. From there you can add tools and spirits as you develop your bartending skills
                            and expand your repertoire.

                            Whether you‚Äôre starting from scratch or giving your bar a much-needed refresh after two
                            years of happy hour at home,
                            here‚Äôs everything you need to make great drinks, plus a few extras to enhance your overall
                            cocktail experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The secret to a great drink is balance, and in order to achieve the perfect ratio of boozy,
                            bitter, and sweet, you need
                            to properly measure your ingredients‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre just starting out. But leave the
                            two-sided jigger to the
                            professionals and get yourself a much more useful tiny measuring cup marked with every
                            increment you need to make a
                            cocktail. There‚Äôs a reason this is at the top of our home bar essentials list: It‚Äôs the best
                            bar tool an aspiring home
                            bartender can buy. If you get yourself just one thing, this should be it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like a mixing glass, a cocktail shaker isn‚Äôt technically necessary because you can use a
                            wide-mouth mason jar with a
                            Hawthorne strainer (see below). But if your favorite cocktails are shaken not stirred, a
                            good shaker will make mess-free
                            work of shaking, and especially pouring, cocktails like daiquiris and Margaritas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mixers are a must for any home bar, but the ones you use will depend on what you and your
                            housemates like to drink. It‚Äôs
                            always a good idea to stock up on club soda and tonic water, but you might also want a spicy
                            ginger beer for a Moscow
                            Mule or a fancy soda to offer a guest (with or without booze). Some home bartenders keep a
                            small stash of shelf-stable
                            tomato juice or Bloody Mary mix and cranberry juice too. Juice-forward drinks like the
                            Tequila Sunrise are better when
                            you squeeze your own orange juice (and make your own grenadine). You can buy simple syrup,
                            but it‚Äôs better when you make
                            it, though thinned agave nectar is often a good substitute for simple syrup when you‚Äôre
                            using an agave spirit like
                            tequila or mezcal (and sometimes when you‚Äôre not).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your meticulously measured and perfectly balanced drink still feels like it‚Äôs missing
                            something, it‚Äôs probably a
                            garnish. Again, how you garnish your cocktail will depend on what you‚Äôre drinking, but if
                            you have your bar stocked with
                            fresh citrus, the good maraschino cherries, martini olives, and maybe even cocktail onions
                            (my personal favorite for a
                            perfect Gibson), you‚Äôll be set. But if you don‚Äôt want to stop there, you can always take
                            your garnish to the next level
                            with a cute cocktail pick.
                        </p>

                            Cocktail making is an art form, there is no doubt about that. However, even if you are a
                            complete beginner, there are a
                            few shortcuts you can take to level up fairly quickly‚Äîpaint by numbers, if you will.

                            If you are in the process of learning how to make cocktails at home, we‚Äôve got you sorted!
                            These nine insider tips will
                            set the stage for success right from the start.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First things first, when you are learning to make cocktails, you do not need to splash out
                            and buy all the ingredients
                            at once. You are 100% allowed to build up your drinks repertoire slowly but surely, adding
                            to it as you go.

                            For cocktail beginners, we‚Äôd recommend starting with high-quality vodka and a great gin as
                            this will allow you to make a
                            variety of classic drinks. As you experiment more, add some bourbon or rum.

                            For mixers, we‚Äôd suggest having a few effervescent options like club soda, sparkling water
                            and ginger beer, as well as
                            fruit juices like cranberry and orange. Add a simple syrup, fresh lemons, limes and ice, and
                            you‚Äôll be ready to create a
                            variety of tasty drinks already.

                            Next up, it‚Äôs time to start building your cocktail-making kit. Again, you don‚Äôt need to get
                            everything all at once‚Äîtake
                            your time in collecting it if you have to and throw out a few well-placed hints for birthday
                            gifts among your nearest
                            and dearest.
                            <br>
                            Here are the six basic pieces of cocktail making equipment we suggest you start with:
                            <br>

                            <b>Cocktail shaker.</b> Regular shakers hold an 18-ounce volume and the larger ones 28
                            ounces. The
                            cobbler shaker is a nice
                            all-in-one solution that features a metal tin for mixing, a cap that measures an ounce, as
                            well as a built-in strainer.
                            <br>
                            <b>Jigger.</b> A jigger is a handy measuring cup with a single shot on one end and a double
                            on the
                            other.
                            <br>
                            <b>Bar spoon.</b> This is a long spoon used to stir cocktails that are served in tall
                            glasses.
                            Strainer. A strainer is used with a cocktail shaker to keep all the ice and debris out of
                            your cocktail when you pour.
                            <br>
                            <b>Muddler.</b> A muddler is a great tool for crushing fruit and herbs to release their
                            lovely
                            flavors.
                            <br>
                            <b>Tongs.</b> A pair of tongs will make you look like the ultimate pro when adding garnishes
                            and
                            ice to cocktails.

                            When learning how to mix cocktails, you are likely to come across all sorts of premixes and
                            drink cordials. These are
                            all good and well, and will definitely allow you to put together an okay-ish drink quite
                            quickly. However, if you want
                            to treat your guests to something spectacular, we always recommend using fresh ingredients.

                            There is just something magical about a lovingly made drink that features the zesty notes of
                            hand-squeezed lime or lemon
                            juice, or the gorgeous green notes of freshly muddled mint or basil. It always leaves a
                            lasting impression. The process
                            takes a little longer, sure, but the extra effort will always be worth your while.
